    <!-- Compared to the solution, I got most of the elements right (I forgot the 'px' on the button's font size). However, as with the css sheet, the formatting on internal styles was simply better than mine. While this is not a big deal with the small style sets we are using for practice, it is not hard to see how important that formating will be once styles become more complex. -->
