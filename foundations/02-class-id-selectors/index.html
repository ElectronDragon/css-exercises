  <!-- Overall, my work is roughly the same as the solution. I think the names of the classes and ids was better in the solution, and I need to work on concise but meaningful names. 
    
    One difference, though, was that I made the font size of para 4 a property of the id (along with color and weight) wherease the solution links it to the an additional class that it shares with para 3. Strictly, this was neither right nor wrong; it is unlcear wether we are going to want the font of paras 3 or 4 to change together or not. However, it's something I didn't even consider, which is telling. Any time two qualities match, I should at least consider whether they ought to be bundled together. -->
